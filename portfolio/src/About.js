      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Shashank Kumar</strong>, a 4th year undergraduate
        student from Sharda University. I am passionate about web development
        and have a strong foundation in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
        React, and Node.js).

        Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects that
        have helped me hone my skills in frontend and backend development. I
        enjoy building user-friendly and responsive web applications, and I am
        always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft.
      </p>

        In addition to my technical skills, I am also a proactive learner and a
        team player. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with
        the latest industry trends. My goal is to leverage my skills and
        knowledge to contribute to impactful projects and grow as a professional
